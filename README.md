# Stock Market Prediction
This Analysis and prediction of stock market
trajectory have been a highly incentivized field of interest to
researchers and investors alike. The purpose of this study is to
forecast the stock prices and sales volume of a domestic and an
international company and ultimately shedding light on the
comparative predictability of both markets. Using various
Exponential Smoothing models, we forecasted selling price for
three consecutive days; furthermore, attempts were made using
Support Vector Machines to predict stock sales volume. In doing
so, we were able to predict the selling price with reasonable
accuracy and demonstrated the apparent contrast between the
domestic and international stock markets in terms of
predictability. This process has been conducted though Oracle's Machine Learning Platform.
